//today's class is about,

-setting default param values ->  es5(setting values inside the function), es6(setting values inside the parameters itself)
-variable no.of arg,  arg less than param varabiles-> undefined ,arg more than param varabiles-> ignored
-arguments object ->helps the function to accept variable number of arguments
-arrow function -> fun.exp, call back function, 'this' keyword
-iife -> immediately invoked function expression, to invoke the function as quick as the function is defined
-pass by value -> copy of that variable value alone passed, pass by reference -> reference of that variable is passed
