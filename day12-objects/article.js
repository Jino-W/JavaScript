    Title : 'Global Warming',
    Body : 'With the approach of Industrial revolutions, the use of chemicals in the factories has increased to a dangerous amount. Along with it, deforestation due to industrial or economic purposes and the excess burning of fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal, has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide from 315 ppmv (part per million by volume) to about 363 ppmv since 1958. These are some of the primary reasons for which the heat gets trapped in the atmosphere thus causing global warming.',

            'Due to global warming, the glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland and Atlantic will melt which will add water to the sea level, thus causing many disasters like Tsunami. A rise in sea level will also have an economic impact especially on the low-lying coastal areas and islands causing unavoidable soil erosion.'
